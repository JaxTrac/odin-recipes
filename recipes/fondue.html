<h2>Description</h3>
<p> My husband grew up in Switzerland and it's there where I truly began to appreciate fondue. </p>
<p> There are many variations of fondue in Switzerland, but this is the most common version. 
    I love the ritual and it's so fun (and easy!) for entertaining. 
    If you can get your hands on it, a splash of kirsch just before serving 
    really gives fondue a fortifying kick.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2.5 cups shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
    <li>2.5 cups shredded Emmental cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, halved</li>
    <li>1.5 cups dry white wine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine Gruy√®re cheese, Emmental cheese, and cornstarch in a bowl. Mix until the cheese is evenly coated. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Rub the cut side of the garlic all over the inside of a fondue pot or heavy saucepan. Add wine and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then gradually add cheese and cornstarch mixture. Stir with a spatula, gently stirring in a figure-of-eight motion, until all of the cheese is added and the fondue is smooth and homogenous. Reduce heat to medium-low if the fondue is boiling too vigorously.</li>
    <li>Immediately serve fondue, preferably over a warmer. If you used a saucepan on the stove to heat the fondue, you can carefully transfer the fondue to a fondue pot to serve.</li>
