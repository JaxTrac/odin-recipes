<h2>Description</h3>
<p> My husband grew up in Switzerland and it's there where I truly began to appreciate fondue. </p>
<p> There are many variations of fondue in Switzerland, but this is the most common version. 
    I love the ritual and it's so fun (and easy!) for entertaining. 
    If you can get your hands on it, a splash of kirsch just before serving 
    really gives fondue a fortifying kick.</p>
